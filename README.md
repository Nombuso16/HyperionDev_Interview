# Section A

Yoour code is well docummented, well done to that. I can easily see what you were trying to do before testing it.

However the code seems not to be functioning but I think there are adjustments that can be made. The problem is, instead of outputting the desired output it runs to an error: 'java: unclosed string literal' in line 7. Also take a look at line 1, 17 and 23 as they pose errors: 'java: class recursion is public, should be declared in a file named recursion.java', "java: unclosed string literal" and 'Variable 'maxNumber' is already defined in the scope' respectively.
I hope these following resources will come into good use:

In all great attempt on your work, the more you practice the more progress you will see. According to your code I can see that you do have an understanding of programming and I would advice that you do more of problem solving.I suggest that you take a look at https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html it might come into good use when it comes to your coding style.

Looking forward to see the updated version. Take care.
