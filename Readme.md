#Section D

Option 1:
- Try and communicate with the students that are left behind via email to find out what could be the problem, because some student might be left behind because they are struggling as they are new to programming and do not get enough support. Therefore providing support by doing random check ups and helping them make adjustements until they are back on track.
- Encourange and allow students to change from 3 months to 6 months if they are not fully committed to the course, whether because of a side job or other committments aside. That could be an advantage to bot the company and the student himself as the pressure would decrease.
- Congratulate and reward students that are always on track so that other students could also get inspired which might lead to an increase of productivity.
- Send out warnings to students that are at risk of falling behind by alerting them regarding the matter, because others might fall behind without being aware.
